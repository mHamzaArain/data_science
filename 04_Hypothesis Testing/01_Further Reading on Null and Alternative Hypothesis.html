<h4>Following a discussion in the Q&amp;A, we have decided to include further clarifications regarding the previous lecture (Null vs Alternative).</h4><p><br></p><p>First, we'd like to note that, conventionally, we always include the equality sign in the null hypothesis. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Student question: </em></strong></p><blockquote><p><em>As per the above logic, in the video tutorial of the salary of the data scientist, the null hypothesis should have been: Data Scientists do not make an average of $113,000. Also in the second example, the null Hypothesis should have been: The average salary should be less than or equal to $125,000. </em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Please explain further. Also please share some further documentation/reference material.</em>
</p></blockquote><p>Now note that the statement is above is <strong>NOT </strong>true. This confusion motivated us to clarify further. </p><p><strong><em>Instructor's answer (with some adjustments as 2-3 answers were combined):</em></strong></p><p>'I see why you would ask this question, as I asked the same one right after I was introduced to hypothesis testing.</p><p>In statistics, the null hypothesis is the statement <strong>we are trying to reject</strong>. Think of it as the 'status-quo'. The alternative, therefore, is <strong>the change or innovation.</strong> </p><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> So, for the data scientist salary example, the null would be: <strong> the mean data scientist salary is $113,000</strong>. Then we will try to <strong>reject </strong>the null with a statistical test. So, usually, your <em>personal opinion </em>(e.g. data scientists don't earn <em>exactly</em> that much) is the <strong>alternative hypothesis.</strong></p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Our friend Paul told us that the mean salary is &gt;=$125,000 (status-quo, null). Our opinion is that he may be wrong, so we are testing that. Therefore, the alternative is: the mean data scientist salary <strong>is lower than </strong>$125,000.</p><p>It surely is counter-intuitive in the beginning, but later on, when you start doing the exercises, you will understand the mechanics.
